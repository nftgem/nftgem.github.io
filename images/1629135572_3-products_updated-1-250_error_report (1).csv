Papa's Select makes California's premier award-winning solventless Living Extracts. We use only top-tier cannabis that has been grown in the world's renowned cannabis region, the Emerald Triangle. Our products provide the truest expression of these plants by only introducing water and heat to the extraction process. Papa’s Select products are considered Living Extracts because they are made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. This process allows us to unlock the potential of the plant at the perfect moment in time and provide the best possible product to our consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made with chemical-free process: uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure.</li>
<li>Unrivaled flavor and terpene profile.</li>
<li>High potency and full spectrum of cannabinoids.</li>
<li>Captures the complete profile of the plant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It’s Made</strong>
Made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. Our process uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure to create the cleanest form of cannabis concentrates.

We use only premium, sun-grown cannabis from small farms in Humboldt County, CA.</p>
<p>About the Process:
Humboldt Apothecary prides ourselves on making quality, effective products with minimal processing, so we’re giving you what you want and deserve: a solventless form of cannabis using a technology that is brand new to the California cannabis industry. Let me tell you about this unique technology called fractalization. It’s a process which implodes the cannabis into powder through pressurization. The process does not use any heat, grinding, or pulverizing, which can damage the contents of the cannabis. Rather than damaging the cells of the cannabis, like other processes, fractalizing completely preserves the contents of the cannabis flower, including terpenes, bioflavonoids, and all of the cannabinoids. Amazing, huh?! When consuming our tablets, you are essentially ingesting every compound contained in the cannabis plant. The effects are pure and powerful, fast acting, and long lasting!</p>","<p>Microcrystalline cellulose, cannabis, natural color, croscarmellose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, dextrin.</p>","<p>300 mg THC per bottle | 10 mg THC per dose (1 tablet)
Exact dosage may vary from batch to batch.</p>
<p>These tablets rapidly dissolve in the stomach and are absorbed into the bloodstream. Once consumed, you will start to feel the effects in approximately 30 minutes.</p>",https://images.ctfassets.net/4a6u5f7bz40f/2lkxHywXdgIk3dLH3SMRCm/d59853e32fbc4e1adb27361235dc6c95/HA-indica-tablets.jpg,https://images.ctfassets.net/4a6u5f7bz40f/2lkxHywXdgIk3dLH3SMRCm/d59853e32fbc4e1adb27361235dc6c95/HA-indica-tablets.jpg,https://images.ctfassets.net/4a6u5f7bz40f/2lkxHywXdgIk3dLH3SMRCm/d59853e32fbc4e1adb27361235dc6c95/HA-indica-tablets.jpg,,"Humboldt Apothecary - Indica Tablets","Category ""Shop/Products/Ingest/Sublinguals"" has not been created.

<p><strong>Why Alcohol Based Tinctures?</strong></p>
<p>The true definition of a tincture is a liquid extract in an alcohol base.  Alcohol is used to extract a wide range of constituents that are present in plants, such as essential oils, resins, alkaloids, and a host of other phytochemicals.  We love alcohol based liquid extracts because they provide a number of distinct benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Absorption:</strong> Alcohol extracts deliver therapeutic benefits faster than other liquids by removing phytochemicals out of the plant and making them available for immediate absorption.  The alcohol base is able to partially bypass the digestive process so that your body can begin absorbing the the liquid as soon as it reaches the mucous membranes in your mouth, stomach, and small intestine.</p>
<p><strong>Taste and Smell:</strong> Alcohol extracts are a more authentic representation of the plants that are featured in the tincture.  They impart the herb’s smell, taste, color, etc.  This is because the tincture will closely match the make-up of the plants from which they are extracted.  This may feel a bit foreign to new tincture users, but tasting these flavors can enhance the effects of the tincture!  Many people find that the flavor of herbs is an acquired flavor and that they rather enjoy the suite of botanical notes in a tincture over time.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Dosing:</strong> Liquid extracts make it easy to titrate a dose that is specific for your needs.  Because you will absorb the phytochemicals relatively quickly in an alcohol base, you can more easily gage if you will require more, or if you have found the perfect dose for your needs.</p>","<p>Alcohol, Honey, Filtered Water, Cannabis Extract, Rosemary, Gotu Kola, Ginkgo.</p>","<p>1 oz (30 servings) : Approximately 250 mg CBD - 250 mg THC per bottle | 8.3 mg CBD - 8.3 mg THC per 1 mL dose/dropperful

The alcohol base is able to partially bypass the digestive process so that your body can begin absorbing the the liquid as soon as it reaches the mucous membranes in your mouth, stomach, and small intestine.</p>
<p><strong>Taste and Smell:</strong> Alcohol extracts are a more authentic representation of the plants that are featured in the tincture.  They impart the herb’s smell, taste, color, etc.  This is because the tincture will closely match the make-up of the plants from which they are extracted.  This may feel a bit foreign to new tincture users, but tasting these flavors can enhance the effects of the tincture!  Many people find that the flavor of herbs is an acquired flavor and that they rather enjoy the suite of botanical notes in a tincture over time.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Dosing:</strong> Liquid extracts make it easy to titrate a dose that is specific for your needs.

They support an energetic, creative daytime high.<br>
Humboldt Apothecary’s swallowable tablets are made using a fractalized, solventless process. The result is a product that is truly full spectrum, where all of the different compounds within the cannabis work together producing more pronounced, longer lasting effects. We use only premium, sun-grown cannabis from small farms in Humboldt County, CA.</p>
<p>About the Process:
Humboldt Apothecary prides ourselves on making quality, effective products with minimal processing, so we’re giving you what you want and deserve: a solventless form of cannabis using a technology that is brand new to the California cannabis industry. Let me tell you about this unique technology called fractalization. It’s a process which implodes the cannabis into powder through pressurization. The process does not use any heat, grinding, or pulverizing, which can damage the contents of the cannabis. Rather than damaging the cells of the cannabis, like other processes, fractalizing completely preserves the contents of the cannabis flower, including terpenes, bioflavonoids, and all of the cannabinoids. Amazing, huh?! When consuming our tablets, you are essentially ingesting every compound contained in the cannabis plant. The effects are pure and powerful, fast acting, and long lasting!</p>","<p>Microcrystalline cellulose, cannabis, natural color, croscarmellose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, dextrin.</p>","<p>300 mg THC per bottle | 10 mg THC per dose (1 tablet)
Exact dosage may vary from batch to batch.</p>
<p>These tablets rapidly dissolve in the stomach and are absorbed into the bloodstream. Once consumed, you will start to feel the effects in approximately 30 minutes.</p>",https://images.ctfassets.net/4a6u5f7bz40f/6KZj13QzUdEm6og6TYRHwZ/09fc3994f77a0da9b6b0cd2824db3f57/HA-sativa-tablets.jpg,https://images.ctfassets.net/4a6u5f7bz40f/6KZj13QzUdEm6og6TYRHwZ/09fc3994f77a0da9b6b0cd2824db3f57/HA-sativa-tablets.jpg,https://images.ctfassets.net/4a6u5f7bz40f/6KZj13QzUdEm6og6TYRHwZ/09fc3994f77a0da9b6b0cd2824db3f57/HA-sativa-tablets.jpg,,"Humboldt Apothecary - Sativa Tablets","Category ""Shop/Products/Ingest/Sublinguals"" has not been created.

The Herbalist is the world’s first perfume incorporating THC, the psychoactive compound of the cannabis plant. Under Drew’s careful guidance, we have selected the sativa-hybrid cannabis cultivar Jack Herer, celebrated for its incredible aromatic properties as well as for its calming, clear-headed, creative and euphoric buzz.</p>
<p>We’ve composed this fragrance around the stunning signature notes of lemon, tangerine and newly crushed pine needles found in the plant itself and carefully balanced them by adding the uplifting freshness of yuzu and grounding woodiness of frankincense. To step up The Herbalist’s functional fragrance game even further, we’ve also included lavender and hinoki, both celebrated for their ability to calm the soul, lift the spirits and soothe.</p>
<p>As you immerse yourself in this lush, expertly layered and completely natural scent, our hope is that you experience a profound and intoxicatingly exquisite connection with the ancient practice of harnessing the goodness of plants, which for us, is at the heart of everything we do.</p>

This allows just the oils and terpenes to be extracted from the trichome heads, leaving the waxy membrane and any plant material behind.
Papa's Select makes California's premier award-winning solventless Living Extracts. We use only top-tier cannabis that has been grown in the world's renowned cannabis region, the Emerald Triangle. Our products provide the truest expression of these plants by only introducing water and heat to the extraction process. Papa’s Select products are considered Living Extracts because they are made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. This process allows us to unlock the potential of the plant at the perfect moment in time and provide the best possible product to our consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made with chemical-free process: uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure.</li>
<li>Unrivaled flavor and terpene profile.</li>
<li>High potency and full spectrum of cannabinoids.</li>
<li>Captures the complete profile of the plant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It’s Made</strong>
Made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. Our process uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure to create the cleanest form of cannabis concentrates. Solventless extracts are different than solvent-free extracts, which use a chemical aid in the extraction process that is later purged out.</p>",<p>Cannabis</p>,"<p>Approximately 741.21 mg THCa - 1.61 mg 9THC - 1.31 mg CBD
