Papa's Select makes California's premier award-winning solventless Living Extracts. We use only top-tier cannabis that has been grown in the world's renowned cannabis region, the Emerald Triangle. Our products provide the truest expression of these plants by only introducing water and heat to the extraction process. Papa’s Select products are considered Living Extracts because they are made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. This process allows us to unlock the potential of the plant at the perfect moment in time and provide the best possible product to our consumers.</p>

Made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness.

Taking effect in 15-30 minutes with a duration of 8-12 hours, these patches provide an even, slow time-release.</p>","<p>Cannabinoids as molecules are too large to permeate beyond the skin, so unless a topically applied cannabis product contains transdermal carriers to break through the stratum corneum (outer layer of skin), topicals are simply skin-deep and local. Transdermal, by definition, is a route of administration wherein active ingredients are delivered across the skin for systemic distribution.
Mary's Patches are typically different than competing varieties. By applying the Transdermal Patches on areas of the body with thin skin and a lot of veins, the cannabis can permeate into the bloodstream for a full body effect similar to smoking or eating edibles. Mary’s patches, which onset in 15-30 minutes and have a duration of between 8 and 12 hours. The effect is an even, slow time-release. Some may feel the patch effects for longer than average, and it’s suggested to leave patches on for approximately 24 hours for the first few uses to gauge effects. We recommend the inside of the wrist, top of the foot or back of the knee for patch placement. Thin skin with a lot of veins is the goal, so that the cannabis oil can transdermally absorb into an advantageous area for systemic. Patches tend to not effect at their full potential if placed on areas not of this nature. For anxiety or a  sore back, it’s best to apply the patch on the inner wrist, etc. It’s important that the area of skin under the patch is cleaned prior to application – either with alcohol or soap and water.</p>
<p>Mary's patches are heat, sweat and water resistant so they will stay in place during active use. Because Mary's patches are made with distillate (other than THCa), the cannabis oil is not visible, slick or likely to cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Patches can be cut down and micro-dosed without activation so that partials can be saved for later use. When cutting down patches, the dosage will proportionately align, but the 8-12 hour time-frame remains. Our packaging is heat/light resistant, thus, a great place to store unused patches.</p>
<p>An intoxicating effect is possible with Mary's transdermal products. The indica and sativa patches will more than likely cause a “high” feeling. The indica and sativa dominances are created with terpene blends. All of Mary’s patches have a unique and consistent terpene blend that’s been created to best synergize with the featured cannabinoid profile. Our terpenes are naturally derived from non-cannabis botanicals.</p>
<p>Time-release technology – slow and steady, when it hits the bloodstream is a function of skin type and where patch is applied on the body. The patch release is activated when applied to something w/o the formulation.</p>

Taking effect in 15-30 minutes with a duration of 8-12 hours, these patches provide an even, slow time-release.</p>","<p>Cannabinoids as molecules are too large to permeate beyond the skin, so unless a topically applied cannabis product contains transdermal carriers to break through the stratum corneum (outer layer of skin), topicals are simply skin-deep and local. Transdermal, by definition, is a route of administration wherein active ingredients are delivered across the skin for systemic distribution.
Mary's Patches are typically different than competing varieties. By applying the Transdermal Patches on areas of the body with thin skin and a lot of veins, the cannabis can permeate into the bloodstream for a full body effect similar to smoking or eating edibles. Mary’s patches, which onset in 15-30 minutes and have a duration of between 8 and 12 hours. The effect is an even, slow time-release. Some may feel the patch effects for longer than average, and it’s suggested to leave patches on for approximately 24 hours for the first few uses to gauge effects. We recommend the inside of the wrist, top of the foot or back of the knee for patch placement. Thin skin with a lot of veins is the goal, so that the cannabis oil can transdermally absorb into an advantageous area for systemic. Patches tend to not effect at their full potential if placed on areas not of this nature. For anxiety or a  sore back, it’s best to apply the patch on the inner wrist, etc. It’s important that the area of skin under the patch is cleaned prior to application – either with alcohol or soap and water.</p>
<p>Mary's patches are heat, sweat and water resistant so they will stay in place during active use. Because Mary's patches are made with distillate (other than THCa), the cannabis oil is not visible, slick or likely to cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Patches can be cut down and micro-dosed without activation so that partials can be saved for later use. When cutting down patches, the dosage will proportionately align, but the 8-12 hour time-frame remains. Our packaging is heat/light resistant, thus, a great place to store unused patches.</p>
<p>An intoxicating effect is possible with Mary's transdermal products. The indica and sativa patches will more than likely cause a “high” feeling. The indica and sativa dominances are created with terpene blends. All of Mary’s patches have a unique and consistent terpene blend that’s been created to best synergize with the featured cannabinoid profile. Our terpenes are naturally derived from non-cannabis botanicals.</p>
<p>Time-release technology – slow and steady, when it hits the bloodstream is a function of skin type and where patch is applied on the body. The patch release is activated when applied to something w/o the formulation.</p>

Our tinctures are made with our specially formulated full plant extract combined with MCT (medium chain triglyceride) oil made from coconuts. MCT oil has nutritional benefits, is easy to digest and is rapidly absorbed by the body. Blending the MCT with our extract also produces a very even tincture because of the compatible molecule size, so the first dropper has the same cannabinoid content as the last. No shaking required.</p>
<p>Only top shelf cannabis flowers are used in our proprietary extraction process. Top shelf flower has the widest and densest cannabinoid, sub-cannabinoid and terpene content available on the plant. We do not use shake, trim, or low-quality bud/flower for our extractions or products, only premium buds.

Mary's and Coltyn collaborated on The Remedy by Coltyn to provide a product for those dealing with GI sensitivities</p>","<p>The Remedy by Coltyn’s namesake, Coltyn Turner, suffered from debilitating Crohn’s disease and Lupus. Coltyn, who was one of the first pediatric medical cannabis patients, and his family moved from their home-state of Illinois to Colorado for access to medical cannabis. Seeking relief using sublingual products, Coltyn often experienced gastrointestinal irritation and Chron’s flare ups due to the food ingredients. This inspired Wendy Turner, Coltyn’s mother, to begin crafting her own sublingual blends to find what would be most gentle and effective for her son. Wendy discovered that safflower oil, a close cousin of sunflower oil, served as incredible carrier oil for cannabis and, alternatively, did not cause Coltyn any distressing GI discomfort.
All the while, Coltyn, a fearless young advocate, built an incredible network called Coltyn’s Crue to support and bring together those suffering from similar health problems. As one of the first pediatric medical cannabis patients, Coltyn went into full remission from Crohn’s disease using only cannabis and continues to advocate for what helped him become “illegally healed”.</p>
<p>Mary's and Coltyn collaborated on The Remedy by Coltyn to provide a product for those dealing with GI sensitivities. This sublingual is formulated to be gentle on the GI-tract, intentionally using safflower-oil as the base, no flavors and Beta-Caryophyllene for its gut-protectant qualities.</p>

Cannabinoids as molecules are too large to permeate beyond the skin, so unless a topically applied cannabis product contains transdermal carriers to break through the stratum corneum (outer layer of skin), topicals are simply skin-deep and local. Transdermal, by definition, is a route of administration wherein active ingredients are delivered across the skin for systemic distribution.</p>
<p>Mary's Patches are typically different than competing varieties. By applying the Transdermal Patches on areas of the body with thin skin and a lot of veins, the cannabis can permeate into the bloodstream for a full body effect similar to smoking or eating edibles. Mary’s patches, which onset in 15-30 minutes and have a duration of between 8 and 12 hours. The effect is an even, slow time-release. Some may feel the patch effects for longer than average, and it’s suggested to leave patches on for approximately 24 hours for the first few uses to gauge effects. We recommend the inside of the wrist, top of the foot or back of the knee for patch placement. Thin skin with a lot of veins is the goal, so that the cannabis oil can transdermally absorb into an advantageous area for systemic. Patches tend to not effect at their full potential if placed on areas not of this nature. For anxiety or a  sore back, it’s best to apply the patch on the inner wrist, etc. It’s important that the area of skin under the patch is cleaned prior to application – either with alcohol or soap and water.</p>
<p>Mary's patches are heat, sweat and water resistant so they will stay in place during active use. Because Mary's patches are made with distillate (other than THCa), the cannabis oil is not visible, slick or likely to cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Patches can be cut down and micro-dosed without activation so that partials can be saved for later use. When cutting down patches, the dosage will proportionately align, but the 8-12 hour time-frame remains. Our packaging is heat/light resistant, thus, a great place to store unused patches.</p>
<p>An intoxicating effect is possible with Mary's transdermal products. The indica and sativa patches will more than likely cause a “high” feeling. The indica and sativa dominances are created with terpene blends. All of Mary’s patches have a unique and consistent terpene blend that’s been created to best synergize with the featured cannabinoid profile. Our terpenes are naturally derived from non-cannabis botanicals.</p>
<p>Time-release technology – slow and steady, when it hits the bloodstream is a function of skin type and where patch is applied on the body. The patch release is activated when applied to something w/o the formulation.</p>

<p>An intoxicating effect is possible with Mary's transdermal products. The indica and sativa patches will more than likely cause a “high” feeling.

Papa's Select makes California's premier award-winning solventless Living Extracts. We use only top-tier cannabis that has been grown in the world's renowned cannabis region, the Emerald Triangle. Our products provide the truest expression of these plants by only introducing water and heat to the extraction process. Papa’s Select products are considered Living Extracts because they are made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. This process allows us to unlock the potential of the plant at the perfect moment in time and provide the best possible product to our consumers.</p>

<p><strong>How It’s Made</strong>
Made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. Our process uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure to create the cleanest form of cannabis concentrates.

Papa's Select makes California's premier award-winning solventless Living Extracts. We use only top-tier cannabis that has been grown in the world's renowned cannabis region, the Emerald Triangle. Our products provide the truest expression of these plants by only introducing water and heat to the extraction process. Papa’s Select products are considered Living Extracts because they are made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. This process allows us to unlock the potential of the plant at the perfect moment in time and provide the best possible product to our consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made with chemical-free process: uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure.</li>

<p><strong>How It’s Made</strong>
Made with cannabis that has been frozen moments after being harvested, while the cannabis flowers are still fresh and at peak ripeness. Our process uses only ice, water, heat, and pressure to create the cleanest form of cannabis concentrates. Solventless extracts are different than solvent-free extracts, which use a chemical aid in the extraction process that is later purged out.</p>",<p>Cannabis</p>,"<p>818.64 mg THCA - 2.02 mg THC - 1.48 mg CBD per package

Cannabis dosing takes a lot of trial and error.  Because individuals require doses that are unique to their body chemistry, it’s best to start with small doses and slowly increase the dose over time to find the lowest dose that works best for you.  Cannabis has a “biphasic” property, meaning that a lower dose can be more beneficial than a higher one.  That’s why we like to start people off with a very low dose, usually 1/4 dropper (.25ml using the graduated dropper).  To enhance absorption, hold under the tongue for 30 to 60 seconds before swallowing.  If needed, you can slowly dose up from there to .5 ml or greater.  For chronic conditions, it may be more beneficial to dose 3 times a day before each meal.  If you find that a tincture does not work after dosing up, then you may want to try another tincture with a different cannabinoid profile and/or ratio.</p>
<p>To prolong shelf life, tinctures may be refrigerated.

Harli-Tsu, bred by the Southern Humboldt Seed Collective and has a Cannabis CBD content 20 times higher than its THC content. Our Harli–Tsu flower brings a welcome relief for pain, inflammation and relaxation and is non intoxicating.
Although this bud is very rare, it is loved for its intensely high levels of CBD that typically falls between 18-22% on average with a THC level of less than 1%. The Harli-Tsu high is very mellow in nature and serves more so as a painkiller than a heavy head or body high. It starts with a happy and uplifted euphoric head buzz felt behind the eyes and in the forehead. This buzz slowly seeps throughout the rest of the body, leaving you completely relaxed and moderately pain free.</p>
<p>As a Sativa Dominant, you’ll feel focused and motivated, leaving you free to tackle any task at hand. These effects and its impressive CBD level make Harle-Tsu perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, inflammation, chronic stress or anxiety, headaches or migraines, and muscle spasms.</p>

THCA does not make you high, however, when it is heated it converts to THC. This oil contains THCA so if stored in a cool location and not heated during preparations, it is nonpsychoactive.
